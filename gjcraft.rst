GameJam
=======
 - You form a team
 - A theme is revealed
 - You have 48 hours to make a game
 - You present what you made

.. note::

  different teams form, 
  my experience is programmer base, 
  other teams often have predominance of graphic artists


-----

Software Craftsmanship
======================

  - Not only working software
  
    - but also well-crafted software
    
  - Not only responding to change
  
    - but also steadily adding value 
    
  - Not only individuals and interactions
  
    - but also a community of professionals
    
  - Not only customer collaboration
  
    - but also productive partnerships 

-----

Working? Well-crafted?
======================

.. note::

  
  Suited to the envisioned future of the thing

  - Working:
    
    - an interresting presentation is the goal, which usually all acomplish
  
  - Well-crafted:
    
    - some: code is ugly (for some def)
    - others: code is as nice as required (for some def)
   
  What is the definition of Well-Crafted?
  

-----

Responding to change? Steadily adding value?
============================================

.. note::

  Being proactive, Definately a successfactor in GJ
  Hopefully during the 48 h
  Usually not after

-----

Individuals and interactions? Community of professionals?
=========================================================

-----

Customer collaboration? Productive partnerships?
================================================


-----

GameJam Craftsmanship
=====================
 - Not only hopefully does something
   - but also completely unmaintainable
 - Not only adding value faster than ...
   - but also grding to a complete halt after exatly 48 hours
 - Not only a comunity of people who have no idea what they are doing
   - but also forging friendships and getting to know each other
 - Not only productive and fun
   - but you will actually learn a lot

-----

Flying
======
.. code:: java

	if (!onGround && notOnGround())
		selectAnimation("air");



-----

Functionality vs maintainability
================================
You have to get something done. This will involve the ugliest code you will ever write.
That is OK. You get a feeling for the extreme end of what is called technical debt.



-----

Ideer
=====

Viktig at det er gøy i starten.

Innebærer "dårlig" kode

Teknisk "gjeld" bygger seg opp veldig raskt

På slutten skjønner ingen koden lengre

Planlagt at på slutten skal det være minst mulig forståelig kode

Minimalt med "prosess"

Live diskusjon i stedet for tasks/issues/tickets

Går lynraskt

ganske slitsomt
i stedet for planlegging, skriking og roping
ad hoc grupper former seg innad i teamet

-----

Eksempler
=========
merging juletre eksempel
notonground
derp
geostreering

-----

Konklusjon
==========

Etter denne erfaringen kan man sette pris på "klassisk" craftsmanship

Får nytt øye for hvorfor man gjør ting slik man gjør

Man får en annen dynamikk enn i vanlig jobbsmmenheng
  - lærer å kjenne
  - begynner å kommunisere på et annet nivå

TODO
====
  - snakke med Tor Stefan
  - Snakke med Marius, Weronika, Andreas, Sergey, Sofija
