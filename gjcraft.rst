GameJam
=======
 - You form a team
 - A theme is revealed
 - You have 48 hours to make a game
 - You present what you made

.. note::

  programmer based team, 
  others might have only one programmer
  nevertheless, collaboration is important


-----

Software Craftsmanship
======================

  - Not only working software
  
    - but also well-crafted software
    
  - Not only responding to change
  
    - but also steadily adding value 
    
  - Not only individuals and interactions
  
    - but also a community of professionals
    
  - Not only customer collaboration
  
    - but also productive partnerships

.. note::

  
  Well-crafted:
    Suited to the intended and probable future of the thing

  - Working:
    
    - an interresting demo is the goal, which usually all acomplish
    - even if it doesnt run, it can be presented
    - 
  
  - Well-crafted:
    
    - some: code is ugly (for some def)
    - others: code is as nice as required (for some def)
    - tech debt: but you never repay it
   
  What is the definition of Well-Crafted?

Working? Well-crafted?

Responding to change? Steadily adding value?
============================================

.. note::

  Adding anything after deadline is not required. 
  Being proactive, successfactor in GJ
  Forseeing the needs of others, and acting on it
  Code structure is only one factor than enables this in a project
  In GJ, team spirit is the deciding factor on this

GameJam Craftsmanship
=====================

-----

Well-craftedness
================

  - Hopefully does something
  
    - realising that "well-crafted" must mean tailored to context and expectations

-----

Adding value
============

 - Adding value faster than f...
 
   - realising value is born out of enabling ones team-mates

-----

Community of professionals
==========================

 - A community of people who have no idea what they are doing
 
   - forgetting limitations and support each others strenghts

-----

Productive partnerships
=======================

  - A desire for forming partnerships
  
   - flows from experiences worth remembering

-----

Flying

-----

Functionality vs maintainability
================================
You have to get something done. This will involve the ugliest code you will ever write.
That is OK. You get a feeling for the extreme end of what is called technical debt.



-----

Ideer
=====

Viktig at det er gøy i starten.

Innebærer "dårlig" kode

Teknisk "gjeld" bygger seg opp veldig raskt

På slutten skjønner ingen koden lengre

Planlagt at på slutten skal det være minst mulig forståelig kode

Minimalt med "prosess"

Live diskusjon i stedet for tasks/issues/tickets

Går lynraskt

ganske slitsomt
i stedet for planlegging, skriking og roping
ad hoc grupper former seg innad i teamet

-----

Eksempler
=========
merging juletre eksempel
notonground
derp
geostreering

-----

Konklusjon
==========

Etter denne erfaringen kan man sette pris på "klassisk" craftsmanship

Får nytt øye for hvorfor man gjør ting slik man gjør

Man får en annen dynamikk enn i vanlig jobbsmmenheng
  - lærer å kjenne
  - begynner å kommunisere på et annet nivå

TODO
====
  - snakke med Tor Stefan
  - Snakke med Marius, Weronika, Andreas, Sergey, Sofija
